# Vit-on-small-data
## ðŸš€ Introduction
In this repo, we present the lightest Vision Transformer (ViT) trained from scratch to achieve ~93% accuracy on CIFAR-10 within just 50 epochs.  
To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest accuracy ever reported with the **lowest compute** and **fastest training time** in the literature for ViTs trained from scratch on CIFAR-10.
